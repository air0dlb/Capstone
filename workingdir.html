Matching an email address
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,5})$/

The first part of the above regex expression uses an ^ to start the string. Then the expression is broken into three separate groups.

Group 1 ([a-z0-9_\.-]+) - In this section of the expression, we match one or more lowercase letters between a-z, numbers between 0-9, underscores, periods, and hyphens. The expression is then followed by an @ sign.
Group 2 ([\da-z\.-]+) - Next, the domain name must be matched which can use one or more digits, letters between a-z, periods, and hyphens. The domain name is then followed by a period \..
Group 3 ([a-z\.]{2,5}) - Lastly, the third group matches the top level domain. This section looks for any group of letters or dots that are 2-5 characters long. This can also account for region-specific top level domains.
Therefore, with the regex expression above you can match many of the commonly used emails such as firstname.lastname@domain.com for example.


let remainingDays = Math.ceil(
  (christmasDate.getTime() - today.getTime()) /
   (dayMilliseconds)
);

let today = new Date();
let christmasYear = today.getFullYear();

if (today.getMonth() == 11 && today.getDate() > 25) {
  christmasYear = christmasYear + 1;
}

let christmasDate = new Date(christmasYear, 11, 25);
let dayMilliseconds = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24;
