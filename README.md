This is a Home Owners Association Website that is created to bring all news for the community to one location for home owners to view what is going on in the subdivision. 
It includes "Countdown the days until Christmas".
It provides the "Current weather for Charleswood Forest" via OpenWeatherMap API. 
It provides a directory for the Charleswood Forest HOA Board members.

Future Features: 
I would like to have the option to pay HOA dues via PayPal or other 3rd party pay eventually/

Current Features: 
Identify 3+ features from the provided list that you've integrated:<br><br>
    1.  Countdown days until Christmas - Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event) <br>
    2.  Weather data - Use arrays, objects, sets or maps to store and retrieve information that is displayed in your app.<br>
    3.  Email validation - Use a regular expression to validate user input and either prevent the invalid input or inform the user about it (in all cases prevent invalid input from being stored or saved).<br>
    4.  Weather API - Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app.<br><br>
